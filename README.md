# What Drives the Price of a Car?

## ðŸ“Š Project Summary

This project aims to analyze and model the factors that influence the price of a car using a publicly available dataset. Through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and regression modeling, we explore the relationships between vehicle features (such as model, condition, fuel type, and transmission) and car price.

The goal is to provide insights for businessesâ€”such as used car dealershipsâ€”to make data-driven pricing decisions.
